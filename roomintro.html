	Hello, boys and girls, and behold our mighty server! This is the ONLY place you can play the best pet mod of 
	all time, CFM! This mod overhauls competitive Pok√©mon as you know it, balancing the meta extensively, 
	applying buffs (and nerfs) to make every monster have some special niche that makes it viable and, above all, make the 
	game more FUN! There is a range of CFM tiers available for the discerning player, ranging from Ubers to PU, and even 
	including a Factory tier! CFM Factory is strongly recommended if you're getting to know the meta or if you just don't 
	feel like teambuilding.
